        <p>Project Title: Shoppy</p>
        <p>Team Number: 13</p>
        <p>Team Members: Brandon Mailloux, Matthew Mckewan, Michael Schneider, Matthew Smith, Matthew Wojcik</p>
        <p>For our site, we decided to focus on selling DVD's of movies. We figured this is a good idea since it is how Netflix started, so hopefully we can be that successful one day. We believe that DVD's are the best form of media ever made, and will have a large comeback into pop culture the way that vinyl records did. We strive to offer the largest DVD selection on the market. Any DVD purchased on our site will be shipped to the customer in 1-2 weeks.</p>
        <p>Tools used: Javascript, jQuery, PHP/MYSQL, Bootstrap</p>
